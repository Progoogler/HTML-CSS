Documented snippets of front-end web practices

The following pages are reviews of common case practices in the mark-up and design of webpages.
Most if not all the documents are specific case-studies from third-party resources available
in the public domain for easy access and dissemination. 

tl;dr: The documents herein this hub are not the product of my development. They are examples of work
that require my closer attention.
