/* 
* As browsers evolve into its modern stages of development,
* vendor prefixes are becoming less common as a standard,
* however, until a modulated consensus is founded across
* all modern browsers, it is a necessary component of
* front-end web development and cross-browser-compatibility.
*
* Refer to http://shouldiprefix.com/
* for an up-to-date reference on where and when to prefix.
